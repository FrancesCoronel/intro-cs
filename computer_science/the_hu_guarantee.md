Students are highly encouraged to either participate in internships or research programs in order to allow students to gain experience in the field.

The students who have had internships with the same company throughout their undergrad are much more likely to get a competitive job offer from said company.

The department is very adamant about students finding either a job or acceptance into graudate school upon graduation.

# It is the department's goal to make 100% job or graduate school placement with each and every graduating class.
