# Minorities Everywhere

> Where we talk about our role in tech.

You have may noticed that the title of this section is a bit of a oxymoron. How can minorities be everywhere if they are the minority?

We'll get to that soon.

But first, let's look at Hampton.

If you're attending *the real HU*,  then perhaps you realize that

> HBCUS are [still] absolutely necessary for Black people as well as for the conscience of the a nation still wrestling with deeply entrenched racism and stratified opportunity structures [source](http://www.ebony.com/news-views/stop-asking-if-hbcus-are-relevant-392#.VPhtFIHF88Y)

**But** perhaps what you don't realize is that as a CS major at an HBCU like Hampton, what you do with your future and the role you play in that said future is more important than you think.

So let's break it down.

# 2040

Well, okay, so what's so important about 2040?

> Well, the year 2040 is when demographers believe minorities will become the majority in the United States.

That means that you, whoever you are, whatever color you are, have a **direct responsibility** to figuring out how to **attract, recognize, and retain diversity in the tech companies** you'll be working and creating yourself.

> We're already seeing the importance of this rapidly growing consumer base and companies are beginning to realize that diverse talent is no longer optional - it's the country's new workforce. [source](http://www.code2040.org/background/)

This discussion all ties in with

> A program called [**CODE2040**](http://code2040.org) (where the # comes from) aims to close the gap that exists in the tech community and to support talented underrepresented technologists as they enter and lead all facets of the tech industry.

The man behind this organization is [Tristan Walker](https://twitter.com/tristanwalker).

At this point, you hopefully know what Silicon Valley is.

If not, give the [TV show](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_%28TV_series%29) a shot, it's pretty hilarious.

Regardless, Walker says the notion of the Valley as a pure meritocracy doesn't always ring true.

> Even the most well-meaning people can discriminate without intending to.

> There's looking at a resume with the name of a woman and forming some idea around the value set that person has, without realizing it.

> There is speaking on the phone with somebody and you happen to potentially sound white â€” and then meeting that person in person, shaking the hand and seeing this look of awe and shock, as if there was some other expectation around how you should look.

If you're a minority in tech, you will probably have to try harder than your counterparts to get ahead in the startup world. You will have to try harder when trying to captivate investors in order to gain venture capital. You will have to try harder to make sure those around don't underestimate you just because of your background or skin color.

**Needless to say, you will have to try harder to achieve the same thing all the time.**

But knowing others are in the same situation will make you stronger and knowing you stood up against the odds makes victory all the sweeter.
