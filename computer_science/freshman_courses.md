## What Math course do I enroll in?

You will be permitted to enroll in the math course required by your major if you meet the following criteria.

Otherwise, you must begin at a lower level math course to prepare for the required entry-level course.

## What English course do I enroll in?

If you took **AP English Language/Literature** and earned at least a **3** on the AP Exam, then you will get **credit for ENG 101**, which is required by all majors and you will therefore be **placed in ENG 102**.

If your writing **SAT** score was **>= 580** or your **ACT** was **>= 25**, then you're eligible to **take ENG 102 Honors**, regardless of whether you took AP English or not since you will be **given credit for ENG 101**, assuming you **pass ENG 102 Honors**.

If **neither** of those **above 2 situations** apply to you, then you must **enroll in ENG 101**.

## I took AP/IB/dual enrollment classes in high school.

If you took AP/IB/dual enrollment (DE) courses in high school, you should be able to **avoid** having to take some **General Education classes** once you get to Hampton.

Make sure that once you arrive to Hampton, you **understand which classes you will still have to take** after AP/IB/DE credit has been awarded to you so that you don't make the mistake of taking a class you may already have credit for.

If you have **30 credits or more** transferred from those AP/IB/DE courses you took in high school by the time you get to Hampton, then **you don't have to take the UNIV 101 course** which is required by Hampton for all freshmen.

You are considered a **sophomore** at Hampton once you have **>= 30 credits**, a **junior** with **>= 60 credits**, and a **senior** with **>= 90 credits**. Anyone with less than 30 credits on their transcript is considered a freshman.

Refer to `Section 2.2.1.2 - Exams` for information on what credit you will get awarded for the exams you took.
