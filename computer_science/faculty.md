# Faculty Overview

Here we will give you a brief overview of faculty in the CS department at Hampton.

For some strange reason, most of the faculty in the CS@HU department have pretty long names.

Anyhow, let's get to know these guys!

> For brevity, we will only be including the faculty that teach higher level CSC courses, so excluding *CSC 120 - Intro to Computers*, which is taught by Angela Hayden, Elaine Dietz, and Susan Zehra, among others.

Let's not forget Mrs. Indira Kadami, who is the secretary for the CS@HU department. She's an integral part of the department and you'll be seeing a lot of her as well.
