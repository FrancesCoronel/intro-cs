# Programs

![](http://honors.cua.edu/res/images/Internship%20image.png)

> By programs, we mean internships, bootcamps, conferences, accelerators, code camps and just general long term immersive sessions that could prove to be a great experience for you.

> None of the programs mentioned are virtual and therefore **require your physical presence**.

> If you're looking for virtual resources, however, refer to `Section 6 - Resources`.
