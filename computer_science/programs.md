# Programs

By programs, we mean internships, bootcamps, conferences, accelerators, code camps and just general long term sessions that could prove to be a great experience for you.

None of these programs are virtual and therefore require your physical presence.

If you're looking for virtual resources, however, refer to [Section 2.4 - Resources](computer_science/resources.md)
