# Bits of Advice

> Where random `bits` of advice from all over the place are provided to you in a somewhat puzzling manner.

---

- When you are creating an application, always assume the user is really stupid. This way, you don't risk creating something that is too difficult to understand or a hassle to use.

- A resume isn't that useful in the technical world, but your projects sure are. That's why you must treat your [GitHub](http://github.com) or coding portfolio as your resume instead.

- Work Smarter, Not Harder
    - Start off the day using **5 minutes to manage your schedule** for the rest of the day and week
    - Jot down **to-dos and deadlines on an electronic list** whenever they arise (apps like [Reminders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminders_%28application%29), [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/), [Keep](https://keep.google.com/))
    - **Transfer to-dos and deadlines to a calendar** (physical/electronic) in morning (try apps like [Calendar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_%28Mac_OS%29), [Google Cal](https://www.google.com/calendar), [Sunrise Calendar](https://calendar.sunrise.am/))
    - Plan day with **realistic time frames**
    - **Move** what you donâ€™t have time for to a **different date**

> Apps that take care of reminders, assignments, and the calendar for school include [iStudiez Pro](http://istudentpro.com/), [Erudio](http://erudio.monospacecollective.com/), [iHomework](http://www.element84.com/ihomework/iOS.html), and [MyStudyLife](https://www.mystudylife.com/). See which one works best for you.

- Defeat Procrastination
    - Build a work routine for big projects so that you make **steady progress** and don't work on it all in one session
    - Try to fit in as **many mini tasks** as possible **between classes**
    - **Study in isolation** without distraction or just with **background** motivational/classical **music**
    - Take a **small break every hour**
    - **Morning and afternoon** are **ideal times for work**, not the evening

- Take notes using your laptop/tablet. Keep all your notes in one application (like [Evernote](https://evernote.com/)).

- Stay organized between your phone and laptop by having the same apps used on both for maximum synchronization.
