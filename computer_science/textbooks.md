[eCampus at Hampton University](http://www.ecampus.com/hamptonu) will tell you which textbooks your teacher will be using ahead of time so you can order them prior to class starting.

However, it is highly recommended you don't actually get the physical copy of any of your textbooks for class unless you know for certain you will be needing it for class or it's mandatory (mainly for classes that have a laboratory section).

> Some professors will only use their textbooks for one assignment the entire semester and then completely disregard it.

> Others will reference the textbook constantly for homework assignments. This is when you'll actually want to go ahead and purchase the textbook.

When it comes to textbooks:

- first try and find a PDF version of the textbook using Google (*and yes, it's possible that you once bought a textbook that was available for free online*)

> make the search faster by inserting  `filetype:pdf` into the search query

- if you find the pdf, save it and then transfer it to your iPhone through iBooks or simply your tablet

- if you can't find it online anywhere, then simply rent the virtual version of the textbook for a semester

- you can go to [BookFinder](http://www.bookfinder.com/textbooks/) or [BookFinder4U](http://www.bookfinder4u.com/cheap_textbooks.html) and compare the prices to find the cheapest price for the textbook you are trying to find

- once you no longer need your textbook, find the highest price you can sell it at on [BookScouter](http://www.bookscouter.com/), where they sell your books for the most money.
