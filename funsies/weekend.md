1. They don't have to provide you with a living. You can still eat if they fail.

2. They don't have a deadline. And as there is no time pressure, you don't revert to your usual formula. You try new things. You experiment. You take risks.

3. This is a labor of love. You provide the labor and you provide the love. So when you spend time on it, it is because you really want to. That keeps you coming back and pushing it on.
