# Faculty Overview

> Here we will give you a brief overview of faculty in the CS department at Hampton.

There are many benefits to getting to know the faculty that you will be working with.

The professors in the CS@HU department are extremely helpful and have a tremendous amount of expertise in their fields.

As a student, you can utilize your professors for all sorts of things including tutoring during office hours, recommendations for jobs or internships, and occasionally even personal advice.

The great thing about Hampton University is that the class sizes are always relatively small, making the professors very accessible.

For some strange reason, most of the faculty in the CS@HU department have pretty long names.

Anyhow, let's get to know these guys!
